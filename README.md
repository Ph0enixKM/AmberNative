# Amber

Programming language that compiles to Bash. It's a high level programming language that makes it easy to create shell scripts. It's particularly well suited for cloud services.  
If [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) it is present in the machine it will be used after the compilation to prettify the Bash code generated.

## Install
Amber compiler currently works on:
- Linux x86 and ARM
- macOS x86 and ARM (Apple Silicon)
- Nix (NixOS)

### macOS / Linux
Make sure that the operating system meets the following prerequisites
- Bourne-again shell (Bash)
- Curl tool for downloading the installation script
- Basic calculator `bc` command (On Debian run `sudo apt install bc`)

#### system-wide install
```bash
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ph0enixKM/AmberNative/master/setup/install.sh" | /bin/bash
```

#### local-user install
```bash
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ph0enixKM/AmberNative/master/setup/install.sh" | /bin/bash -s -- --user
```

#### Via a package manager

### Snap
You can install the snap package in any distro via
the store:
[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/amber-bash)

or from the terminal:
```bash
sudo snap install amber-bash --classic
```

[Don't have snapd installed?](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install)

Amber is packaged in the following distros:

Arch (AUR) - `amber-bash-bin`

#### Nix

See [NIX.md](./NIX.md)

### Windows support
As windows does not come with bash installed it makes no sense to support it. Please install WSL 2 on your windows machine and install Linux version of Amber compiler inside.

In order for it to work you may need to run the following code that pulls all the prerequisites.

```bash
sudo apt install curl bc
sudo mkdir /opt /usr/local/bin
```


## Contributing
In order to contribute, you have to add couple of build targets:
```bash
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
```

And linkers (macos):
```bash
brew install messense/macos-cross-toolchains/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
brew install messense/macos-cross-toolchains/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

Compile it:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ph0enixKM/Amber
cd Amber
cargo build
```

In order to build the installer scripts run:
```bash
amber build.ab
```

Debugging Amber:
```bash
// Shows the AST
AMBER_DEBUG_PARSER=true cargo run <file.ab>
// Shows the time it took to compile each phase
AMBER_DEBUG_TIME=true cargo run <file.ab>

// Flamegraph is a profiling tool that is used to visualize the time each function took to execute
sudo cargo flamegraph -- <file.ab> <file.sh>
```

## Github Actions
We are using `cargo-dist` to build the binaries for all the platforms. The binaries are then uploaded to the release page once a new release a tag is created.
