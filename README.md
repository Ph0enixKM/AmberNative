# Amber

Programming language that compiles to Bash. It's a high level programming language that makes it easy to create shell scripts. It's particularly well suited for cloud services.  
If [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) it is present in the machine it will be used after the compilation to prettify the Bash code generated.
